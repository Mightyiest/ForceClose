# ForceClose
 This AutoHotkey (AHK) script allows you to forcefully close the currently active window by pressing a customizable hotkey (Ctrl + Del by default). It provides both a graceful close method (sending a close signal to the window) and an aggressive method (forcefully terminating the process).
